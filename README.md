The Wazafny: Online Job Management System (AI Job Provider) was developed to bridge the 
gap between job seekers and employers by providing an intelligent, accessible, and user-friendly 
platform. By leveraging modern web and mobile technologies, React for the web front-end, 
Flutter for the mobile application, Laravel for the back-end API, and FastAPI for the AI-powered 
job recommendation engine, the system delivers a seamless and responsive experience across 
devices. 
Through a structured development lifecycle, including detailed planning, analysis, design, 
implementation, and rigorous system testing, the platform was crafted to meet both functional 
requirements (like job posting, searching, applying, and profile management) and non
functional requirements (like performance, scalability, and security). 
Core modules such as secure authentication, company and job seeker management, AI-based job 
matching, and notification systems were successfully implemented and tested. User testing and 
feedback indicated that the platform is effective, intuitive, and valuable for its target audience. 
The integration of AI significantly enhanced the relevance of job suggestions, contributing to a 
more personalized and efficient user experience. 
In summary, Wazafny lays a strong foundation for modernizing the recruitment process. It 
empowers job seekers with intelligent tools to discover suitable opportunities and equips 
employers with a streamlined way to connect with qualified candidates. The system enhances 
engagement, reduces hiring inefficiencies, and supports better employment outcomes, making it a 
practical and impactful solution in the field of digital recruitment.
